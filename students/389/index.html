        Having experimented with guerilla gardening, and growing indoors 
        without sunlight and soil, I am strive to fabricate an automated 
        system that will produce food for a small to medium size family 
        inside of a 100sqft area; Whether it be inside of a home, or as 
        an external structure.

        My focus is on hydroponic systems working in tandem to grow a 
        variety of foods ranging from simple leafy greens, to tomatoes and 
        peppers. 
        One challenge I hope to tackle is grwing root/tuberous vegetables 
        without soil or growing medium hydro/aeroponically.

        Another problem I want to begin to tackle is designing "modular root 
        system capture and control" pods. 
        If control of root growth, and root containment of the entire root
        system of larger flora in a minimized amount of space, it become 
        more likely and easier to grow and raise larger flora inside of 
        artifiial agriculture systems.
