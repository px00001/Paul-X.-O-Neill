<FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT FACE="Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
am originally from the metro-Boston area. When I was an adolescent, I
enjoyed &quot;Erector&quot; sets, model airplanes, Radio Shack
electronic experiments, chemistry sets, science fairs. In 1973, as a
young teenager, I was fortunate enough to have access to a Digital
Equipment Corporation PDP-8 minicomputer which was donated by the
Tuck family to my high school. The minicomputer was previously at The
Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, and it had a very
very early implementation of the BASIC programming language. The
machine had to be booted using rocker switches and was pretty
impractical, but very interesting. After I learned to drive, I would
take the family car out to Maynard, Massachusetts and visit the lobby
of Digital Equipment Corp, where they had some CRT terminals that you
could try.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT FACE="Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
later entered the US Merchant Marine Academy where I studied Marine
Engineering. I spent a year out at sea learning all about machinery,
boilers, turbines, generators, refrigeration, and diesel engines.
While at the Academy, I was introduced to DTSS - Dartmouth Time
Sharing System, which we accessed via teletype. This was the first
viable commercial network system of it's time. Prior to having any CS
courses, I managed to gain access to the mainframe system at
Dartmouth, a Honeywell system and started exploring it's assembler
code, GMAC. So, two months into the Academy, during the fall of 1976,
I decided I would see how many programs a time sharing system could
run at the same time. I wrote a program called GERM which basically
replicated itself like a virus. Each copy was supposed to print on
the terminal what copy it was. I ran the program at 7:45 am before
morning colors. By 11:00 I was escorted down to the Admiral's office,
where I was introduced to some attorneys representing the Trustees of
Dartmouth College, who promptly interrogated me as to why I was
maliciously tampering with DTSS during midterms. Long story made
short, I was forgiven for writing what was the first virus on a
commercial system.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the time I graduated the Academy, the folks up at Dartmouth got to
know me pretty well. I was invited to attend the Inaugural Class of
the Masters Program in Computer &amp; Information Science at
Dartmouth College, the first IT program of it's kind, founded by Drs.
John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz. Kemeny was the President of Dartmouth,
and in his earlier life, he was Albert Einstein's mathematics
assistant. Kurtz was the co-inventor of BASIC and time-sharing, along
with Kurtz. Both are IEEE Hall of Fame members and very impressive
people. In fact, everyone in the program, faculty and students alike,
were very impressive in their own ways.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT FACE="Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>One
month after graduating from CIS, I had the misfortune of being a
passenger in a car which was struck by a drunk driver. I was a
multiple-trauma victim, with multiple compound fractures of the
pelvis, right forearm, as well as a pseudo-traumatic thoracic aortic
aneurysm. Mortality rate for the pelvic fracture at the time was 85%.
My doctors never seen anyone survive the aneurysm, but they devised a
way to repair me. I worked hard at recovering and was grateful that I
received great care and support from my doctors, nurses, family and
friends. While still in traction, I went to work in IT for the first
time, working for the Computer Corporation of America on their COMET
email system. I would travel with platform crutches and manage to get
it out of the vehicle by hopping on my one good leg. I adapted what I
had at the time so I could get to work. I frightened a few people
along the way because I looked a little unusual with screws and bars
coming out of my right forearm. I would apologize for my appearance
and try to put them at ease with a big smile. I avoided handshakes
because it was very painful to do so.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

recovered nicely, working hard to get back to doing nearly everything
I used to do before I was injured. I was fortunate to recover as well
as I did. In 1990, I started volunteering as an adaptive ski
instructor at a ski area called Waterville Valley. I used my
tinkering skills to make equipment and adaptations for people with
disabilities to learn how to ski. I continued to teach for about 10
years after that.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT FACE="Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>My
professional career after that involved computers, engineering,
fabrication and real estate. At one point, I was the owner of a
shipyard (APEC - Hingham Shipyard) where I was operating a large
metal fabrication and machining business. One of the more interesting
projects I designed and built was a special 5-axis CNC machines for
Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics. I had CNC horizontal
boring mills, CNC bridge mills, robotic welders, ASME code stamps. I
would also build special machines for Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Harvard University, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
(SAO), Brookhaven National Laboratory and Amtrak to name a few. In
fact MIT rented 160,000 square feet of my shipyard for constructing
of a large international physics project, adjacent to my machine
shop.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

also sponsored, and was one of the lead faculty for the 1996-1997 MIT
Solar Electric Vehicle Team. This student group used my shipyard as
their maker space for constructing the Manta GT. This was the first
time the team used CNC technology to mold the plug for the car body.
I taught them concepts of milling and mold making, and how to convert
a 3-D model into G-Code and communicate it into a machine tool. We
all worked incessantly together for 6 months on the project. For my
effort, this group awarded me an honorary PhD, which I did not
expect. I am still friends with some of the team members today. One
of my students, Jorge Barrara, has continued this passion, and has
become the lead faculty at EAFIT University - Columbia, for the
Primavera Solar Race Car, one of the best in the world today.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

of the things I do today is volunteer running &ldquo;Tech Club&rdquo;
at a school called Menlo Park Academy. MPA is a K-8 public charter
school located in the inner city of Cleveland, OH. It's student body
is comprised of exclusively gifted learners and twice exceptional
learners of all kinds. Exceptional learners are students who have
special needs or disabilities in addition to their high potential to
learn. Many are underachievers which when placed in a typical school,
fail to achieve. They seem to respond well while learning among other
gifted learners. I have 3<SUP>rd</SUP> grade students which are
asking me for help with Gitlab, Cloud9, and Python, so I thought I
better bone up on my tech skills so I can help these great kids keep
achieving.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
